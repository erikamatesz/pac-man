# Pac-man

My implementation of [pacmancode.com](https://pacmancode.com/.com) just for fun :) 

## Setup (MacOS / Linux)

Create a venv:

```sh
python3 -m venv pacmanenv
```

Activate the venv:

```sh
source pacmanenv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to deactivate the venv:

```sh
deactivate
```
